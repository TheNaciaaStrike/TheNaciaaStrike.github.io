You are traveling abroad having fun only to return home and see all you beloved plants dried up and dead. You are sad and angry. You are angry at yourself for not taking care of them. You are disappointed in yourself becaus you forgot to ask for a favor from you friend or family to watch them over while you are way. If only there was a solution to this porblem where you could remotly monitor your plants and see how well they are dooing while making sure they are watered and have enough light. Well, there is a solution. It is called the Yuuka project.\nOK\u0026hellip;. No more flluff. This project has 2 main goals:\nTo create a system that can monitor and look after plants. To create a system that will notfity use when there is a lack of water or light. To achive these goals, I will be using a Raspberry Pi 3b+ and Arduino UNO, a light sensor, a moisture sensor, a water pump and a water reservoir. The Raspberry Pi will be used to control the water pump. Light sensor will be used to measure the light intensity. The moisture sensor will be used to measure the moisture level in the soil. The water pump will be used to water the plants. The water reservoir will be used to store water for the water pump. But this is not all the parts of the system. The system will also have a web interface that will be used to monitor the plants and control the water pump. The web interface will be created using the Django framework. The web interface will also be used to configure the system.\nNow all this is not enough. These are just core components. There will be more components such as tempreture sensors, humidity sensors, water level sensors, solenoid valves adding a camera would be nice\u0026hellip;. and most likely more that I cant think of on the top of my head.\nWhat is Yuuka?\u003e What is Yuuka? # This sections should more likly be name \u0026ldquo;The Why?\u0026rdquo;.\nThe main questions that come to mind are:\nWhy is this project called Yuuka? Why is it needed? Lets start with the awnsers\nWhy is this project called Yuuka?\u003e Why is this project called Yuuka? # Well the answer is simple. Because of the way FQDN is constructed. The FQDN for this project is yuuka.localdomain. The FQDN is constructed by taking the name of the project and adding it to the domain name. to put in in laymens terms, when you got to for egzample google.com, you are actually going to www.google.com. The www part is the subdomain or the name of the server. The google part is the name of the domain. The .com part is the top level domain. Therefore every computer that is connected to the internet has a server name. In Windows it\u0026rsquo;s automaticaly generated during the install process. While in linux unless you set one yourself it will be the distibituon name.\nThat was a lot of thechincal text that was booring. Lets just say that the name yuuka will be the server(In this case the Raspberri pi 3B+) name from this point on and will be refered to as such (note the lower case lettering when it all lower case or all uppercase it will refrence the server Otherwise it will refer to the character).\nThe name Yuuka is a reference to the character Yuuka Kazami from the Touhou Project. Here is her charecter profile from the Touhou wiki:\nYuuka Kazami (風見　幽香 Kazami Yuuka) is a long-lived youkai called the \u0026ldquo;Flower Master of the Four Seasons\u0026rdquo; whose main place of activity is the Garden of the Sun, a field completely covered in sunflowers. She loves seasonal flowers, so throughout the year she moves to the respective places where the flowers grow: spring flowers for spring, summer flowers for summer, autumn flowers for autumn and sometimes winter flowers for winter.\nWhy is it needed?\u003e Why is it needed? # Well to put it simply most of the services that offer automation solutions are either too expensive or too complicated or are only for commercial use. So this porject will be one few that is free and open source. It will also be one of the few that is easy to use and is not for commercial use. Although it will be more of a DIY project due to the open source nature of the project and hardware, it will be easy to use and will be easy to set up.\nAnother thing is that most uses will be able to set this up by themselfs mostly. Therefore reducing stress and minimizing the risk of neglecting the plants. This will also reduce the risk of the plants dying due to lack of water or light. All that will be left is for the User to add extra water to the water reservoir and to add more plants to the system (ONLY if needed).\nFinlay the plants will be able to share there bueaty to the user. The user will be able to see the plants and will be able to see how well they are doing.\n","date":"22 February 2023","permalink":"/yuuka/1_thewhat/","section":"The Yuuka Project","summary":"Learn more about Yuuka and why I am starting this project.","title":"1.
